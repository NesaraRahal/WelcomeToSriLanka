            <p class="text">Sri Lanka’s ancient kingdoms date back over 2,500 years, giving its wildlife, waterfalls, ruins and reams of tea plantations an aura of enlightenment. As an island nation, the country benefits from a wonderful feeling of remoteness, making it easy to lose yourself amidst the tropical rainforests, immaculate white-sand beaches and age-old towns. The southern Hill Country is home to Ella, with its rumbling Ravana Falls and the 1,300-metre-high cliff or Ella’s Rock - reachable via a scenic two-hour trek along a tea-house-laden railway track. <span class="moreText">Some of Sri Lanka’s best beaches can be found in Tangalla, Kalpitiya and Hikkaduwa, with some offering water sports, dolphin and whale watching, and snorkeling. For safari adventures, the country boasts a wealth of stunning national parks. Yala is the best spot for leopards, while Udawalawe and Wasgamuwa are home to parades of wild elephants. If you’re in search of ancient ruins, head for the sites of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to discover architectural gems such as huge dagobas (dome-shaped structures containing relics). Sri Lanka offers a wide range of beach hotels, and mountain top villas surrounded by tea plantations. There’s also a variety of apartments, B&Bs and independent homestays available.</span></p>

              We have just got back from a truly fantastic holiday in Sri Lanka. We had booked our holiday with Kuoni, and they excelled in the service given to us. Our rep Lal is Sri Lankan, which was a huge bonus.
              <span class="moreText">We did the South Sri Lanka tour, which is an excellent way to see some of the country, although it does become very tiring towards the end. The last five days of our holiday were spent at Browns Beach, which was brilliant.
              If you are looking for a holiday that is a little bit different, this is for you. We had glorious weather, food like I have never tasted before, and the locations were just wonderful.
              This sort of holiday will not suit everybody; you need to have an open mind as to other cultures and ways and accept them as they are. If you can do this, you will be amazed at so many things that Sri Lanka has to offer to you, the lucky traveler.

              Sri Lanka is a very clean and a beautiful country. I visited Galle, Mirissa, Ella, Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Sigiriya and Colombo in June. The beaches were quite empty (because of offseason),<span class="moreText"> beautiful and clean. The mountains were mesmerising and the history related to the country was quite amazing. The train ride part from Ella to Kandy is a must take one. It offers you a combination of enchanting hills, tea plantations, splendid bridges and waterfalls.
